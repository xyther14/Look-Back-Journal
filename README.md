Privacy Policy for Look Back Journal

This app is a personal journal writing application that you can use to go back in time and look what you were feeling on any particular day. The app stores your journals in your phone local storage. To guess the emotion from your journal we call an API to determine what you are feeling based on your entry.

Further more, we ask for microphone permission so that it's easier for you to save your journal. Just click on the microphone and say what you are feeling and it will get stored in the text field. We also have a AI assistant to help you navigate through the app. Just ask the AI "Show Journal on 15th February" and it will take you to the journal entry on that day.

Your data is yours, as it should be.
